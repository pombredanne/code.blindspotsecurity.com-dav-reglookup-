RegLookup Installation
======================

Prerequisites
-------------

This package doesn't require much for installation.  Just what typically
comes with any free operating system.  Be sure you have:

 - GNU Make
 - GCC


Survival Commands
-----------------

make
# and as root
make install

If GNU Make isn't your default, you may need to run `gmake' instead.


Advanced Installation
---------------------
To install in a custom directory, simply change one or more of the
following make variables to suit your needs:

 PREFIX      Top level install directory.  Used as base for rest unless
             they too are overridden. (This defaults to /usr/local)

 BIN_PREFIX  Location for executable programs to be installed.

 DOC_PREFIX  Location for documentation.

 MAN_PREFIX  A path in the MANPATH.


Use the following syntax (with GNU Make) to override a variable:

# as root
make VAR=value install


For more information, see the Makefiles.
