RegLookup Installation
======================

Prerequisites
-------------

RegLookup and its associated libraries have the following build dependencies:

 - SCons (package "scons" in most popular distributions or from http://www.scons.org/)
 - GCC
 - talloc 2.x (under Debian, "libtalloc2" and "libtalloc-dev")
 - Python 2 (2.6+) or Python 3  (Python is required for SCons anyway)
 - Doxygen (optional, only needed to build developer documentation)

Note that iconv support is required, as specified in IEEE Std 1003.1 
(POSIX.1-2001).  Some platforms still do not contain support for this 
natively, in which case you may need to install libiconv from:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/


Survival Commands
-----------------

scons
# and as root
scons install


Advanced Installation
---------------------
By default, most RegLookup files are installed in the appropriate
directories under /usr/local.  In order to override this behavior, set
the PREFIX environment variable to the desired path.  For example:

$ PREFIX=/home/myuser/reglookup scons install
