If you are interested in contributing to this project, here's a few
things you could look into:

 - Testing, testing, and more testing.  reglookup needs to be tested on 
   NT/XP/2k3.  A regression test suite would be nice too.

 - Build system.  I do not wish to use automake/autoconf in this
   project.  However, more intelligent use of make would be nice.
   I don't know it that well.

 - Unicode support.  I have never internationalized any software
   before.  This would be a big help for the SZ, EXPAND_SZ, and MULTI_SZ
   data types.

 - Grep through the source for 'XXX', and you'll find more.
