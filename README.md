# What is this?

The RegLookup project is devoted to direct analysis of Windows NT-based registry files. RegLookup is released under the GNU GPL, and is implemented in ANSI C. RegLookup provides command line tools, a C API, and a Python module for accessing registry data structures. The project has a focus on providing tools for digital forensic examiners (though is useful for many purposes), and includes algorithms for retrieving deleted data structures from registry hives.

# Where do I learn more?

See the [main project site](http://projects.sentinelchicken.org/reglookup/).  You'll find official releases there and more documentation.


# What if I have trouble?

Ask for help on the [development mailing list](http://projects.sentinelchicken.org/reglookup/mailing-list) or submit an issue here on GitHub.


# Is this project maintained anymore?

RegLookup is largely feature-complete for what we wanted to accomplish.  So the releases are infrequent (typically only when bugs crop up), but the project is still maintained.


# How do I contribute?

We love contributions.  However, for now this GitHub mirror is just that, a static mirror, so please don't submit pull requests.  Just send us a patch on the development mailing list.
