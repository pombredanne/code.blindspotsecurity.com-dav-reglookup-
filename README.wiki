<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
The RegLookup project is devoted to direct analysis of Windows NT-based registry files. RegLookup is released under the GNU GPL, and is implemented in ANSI C. RegLookup provides command line tools, a C API, and a Python module for accessing registry data structures. The project has a focus on providing tools for digital forensic examiners (though is useful for many purposes), and includes algorithms for retrieving deleted data structures from registry hives.

<h2> Is this project maintained anymore? </h2>
<p>
RegLookup is largely feature-complete for what we wanted to accomplish.  So the releases are infrequent (typically only when bugs crop up), but the project is still maintained.

We love contributions.  To submit a patch, please check out the trunk, apply your changes and run "<code>svn diff</code>".  Save the resulting diff and attach it to a ticket.
