reglookup


=NAME=
	reglookup - Windoze NT/2K/XP registry reader/lookup tool


=SYNOPSIS=
	reglookup [options] <REGISTRY_FILE>


=DESCRIPTION=
	reglookup is designed to read Windoze registry elements and
	print them out to stdout.  It has several filtering options to
	narrow the focus of the output.


=OPTIONS=
	-f<PREFIX_FILTER>	
		Specify a path filter.  Only keys/values under this
		registry path will be output.

	-k	TODO

	-p	TODO

	-s	TODO
	
	-t<TYPE_FILTER>
		Specify a type filter.  Only elements which match this
		registry data type will be printed.  Acceptable values
		are: SZ,EXPAND_SZ,BIN,DWORD,MULTI_SZ,KEY

	-v	Verbose output.


	REGISTRY_FILE
		Required argument.  Specifies the location of the
		registry file to read.  Typically, these files will be
		found on a Windoze partition under
		%SystemRoot%/system32/config. 


=EXAMPLES=
	To read and print an entire registry:

	**reglookup /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system**

	To limit the output to just those entries under the Services
	key: 

	**reglookup -f'$$$PROTO.HIV/ControlSet002/Services' /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system**

	To limit the output to all registry values of type BIN:

	**reglookup -tBIN /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system**
	
	And to limit the output to BIN values under the Services key:

	**reglookup -tBIN -f'$$$PROTO.HIV/ControlSet002/Services' /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system**


=BUGS=
	Path filtering is currently a slow hack.

	The current incarnation of this program has only been tested on
	Windoze 2000.

	You'll notice that registry paths aren't all the same as the
	ones the equivalents you see in Windoze.  Don't ask me why that
	is.  I just work here.

	This software should be considered unstable at this time.
